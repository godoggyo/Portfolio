      Hello and Welcome to my website!</br></br>
      My name is Jacob Nachman and I am a Computer Engineering student at Iowa
      State University. While I am a computer engineering student, I also have a
      Sales Engineering minor and have a strong passion for computer programming and
      software development. I first gained interest in computers when I was 14 years
      old by learning how to jailbreak my iPod touch and set up an ssh server. From
      there I did my research and decided to take a Java class in high school to see
      if I would be interested in programming. I absolutely loved it and took a class
      at a local community college about networking, programming, and computer hardware.
      In the fall of 2015 I enrolled in my freshman year at Iowa State University.
      When I went to ISU I decided to study computer engineering. In my career here
      at Iowa State, I have done various projects, both inside and outside of school,
      ranging from things like embedded programming to things like this website.
      I really have a passion for hardware and software development and hopefully
      I can show you some of this passion through this website.
